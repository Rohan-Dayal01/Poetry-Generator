# Poetry-Generator
Using NLTK library, automatically generates 4 line poem. Each line must have 6 syllables. Each word in a line must rhyme with the previous word in the line, but consecutive lines need not rhyme. If takes too long to generate a rhyming word under syllable constraints, will just generate word that is similar according to conditional frequency distribution.
